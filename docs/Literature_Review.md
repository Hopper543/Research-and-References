# Literature Review: Multimodal Emotion Recognition for Space Applications

## Executive Summary
Analysis of existing research and datasets for developing AI-based emotional well-being monitoring systems for astronauts in long-duration space missions.

## 1. Emotion Recognition Datasets Analysis

### 1.1 Facial Expression Datasets
**FER2013** (Primary Dataset)
- 35,887 grayscale facial images (48x48 pixels)
- 7 emotion categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral
- **Limitation for Space Context**: Laboratory conditions vs. space station environments
- **Applicability**: Baseline training but requires domain adaptation

### 1.2 Speech Emotion Datasets
**RAVDESS** (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database)
- 24 professional actors (12 male, 12 female)
- 7,356 recordings covering speech and song
- Emotions: neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised
- **Space Relevance**: Controlled audio quality vs. space station acoustics

**TESS** (Toronto Emotional Speech Set)
- 2 actresses, 200 target words
- 7 emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pleasant surprise, sadness, neutral
- **Advantage**: High audio quality for clear emotion articulation
