# MAITRI: Research References for Astronaut Well-being AI

**Project ID 25175** - SIH 2025 | **Organization:** Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)

## Problem Statement
Long-duration space crew face isolation, disrupted sleep and physical stress that can trigger serious health issues. This challenge calls for a multimodal AI "companion" that monitors astronauts via audio-video inputs to detect emotional or physical distress.

## Research Scope
This repository contains research references and technical bibliography for developing an AI assistant for astronaut psychological well-being monitoring on the Bhartiya Antariksh Station.

## Contents
- `docs/Research_References.pdf` - Complete bibliography
- `docs/Literature_Review.md` - Research analysis  
- `docs/Dataset_References.md` - Training data sources
- `Technical_Approach.md` - Proposed methodology

## Key Research Areas
- Multimodal emotion recognition (face + speech)
- Offline AI deployment for space environments
- Psychological support systems for isolated crews
- Edge computing on space-grade hardware

*Note: This repository contains research references only, not implementation code.*
