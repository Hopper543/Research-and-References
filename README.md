# MAITRI: Research References for Astronaut Well-being AI

**Project ID 25175** - SIH 2025 | **Organization:** Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)

## Problem Statement
Long-duration space crew face isolation, disrupted sleep and physical stress that can trigger serious health issues. This challenge calls for a multimodal AI "companion" that monitors astronauts via audio-video inputs to detect emotional or physical distress and provides adaptive counseling to maintain their well-being.

## Research Scope
This repository contains research references and technical documentation for developing an AI assistant for astronaut psychological well-being monitoring on the Bhartiya Antariksh Station.

## Repository Contents

### ðŸ“‚ docs/
- **Research_References.pdf** - Complete bibliography of datasets and research papers
- **Literature_Review.md** - Analysis of existing research and identified gaps  
- **Dataset_References.md** - Detailed information on training datasets

### ðŸ“„ Technical_Approach.md
Proposed research methodology and system architecture for developing the multimodal emotion recognition system.

## Key Research Areas
- Multimodal emotion recognition (facial expressions + speech analysis)
- Offline AI deployment for space environments
- Edge computing on space-grade hardware (NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Google Coral)
- Psychological support systems for isolated crews

## Source References
All research is based on publicly available datasets and official space agency research:
- **FER2013, RAVDESS, TESS** datasets for emotion recognition training
- **NASA Human Research Program** for space psychology foundations
- **NVIDIA Jetson Nano & Google Coral** for edge deployment platforms
